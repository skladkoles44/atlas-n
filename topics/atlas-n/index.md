# ATLAS N

Status: active
Confidence: medium

Nothing here is dogma. This topic is a lab notebook.

## Anchors (papers)
- [ATLAS N (EN)](../../papers/atlas-n/ATLAS_N_EN.md)
- [ATLAS N (RU)](../../papers/atlas-n/ATLAS_N_RU.md)

## Notes (chronological-ish)
(Empty for now — new notes go into `notes/` and are linked here.)

## Open questions
- What is the minimal stable “ContextSnapshot” that preserves predictive power?
- How do we detect landscape drift vs measurement noise?
- What is the smallest MVRS that still prevents self-deception?

## Glossary (local)
- C×K → O: configuration × context → outcome
- MVRS: Minimum Viable Rule Set (executable canon)
