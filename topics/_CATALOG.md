# Topic Catalog

This file is the routing map for new notes.
Nothing here is dogma. Topics can be split/merged/renamed.

## topics/atlas-n
Scope: ATLAS N methodology, exploration of configuration spaces, MVRS as executable canon, Phase separation, reproducibility-as-law, partial observability, structural map (clusters/boundaries/chaos), information-driven experimentation.
Keywords: atlas n, mvrs, phase i, phase ii, reproducibility, context snapshot, entropy, information gain, cartography, boundaries, clusters, chaotic regions, non-stationarity.
Anti-scope: pure implementation details of a specific codebase unless they change the methodology.
