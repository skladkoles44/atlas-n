This repository is an idea vault: thoughts, hypotheses, models, doubts, observations.
Not a product. Not documentation. Not a tutorial.
Nothing here is dogma. Everything is provisional, revisable, and allowed to be wrong.

## Primary anchors (papers)
- ATLAS N (EN): papers/atlas-n/ATLAS_N_EN.md
- ATLAS N (RU): papers/atlas-n/ATLAS_N_RU.md

## How to add new material
Rules:
1) One file = one idea (or one tightly scoped chunk).
2) Prefer meaningful filenames over dates (use dates only when it matters).
3) Every file starts with:
   - Status: sketch | hypothesis | tested | falsified | abandoned
   - Confidence: low | medium | high
4) Link related ideas explicitly (use relative links).
5) If an idea is wrong, keep it: mark Status=falsified and add a short note.

## Suggested layout (when we expand beyond papers/)
- ideas/        (short notes, one-per-file)
- models/       (formal sketches, invariants, math)
- failures/     (postmortems, breakages, lessons)
- philosophy/   (meta-level constraints and uncomfortable truths)
- archive/      (deprecated or superseded material)

## Notes
If you are reading this as a public repo: treat it as a lab notebook, not a promise.
