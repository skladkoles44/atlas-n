This repository is an idea vault: thoughts, hypotheses, models, doubts, observations.
Not a product. Not documentation. Not a tutorial.
Nothing here is dogma. Everything is provisional, revisable, and allowed to be wrong.

## Primary anchors (papers)
- ATLAS N (EN): papers/atlas-n/ATLAS_N_EN.md
- ATLAS N (RU): papers/atlas-n/ATLAS_N_RU.md

## Canon: how we store ideas
Core rule: one topic = one directory. Each topic may contain N files (multiple thoughts about the same thing).

Routing map:
- Topic catalog (where to file new material): topics/_CATALOG.md

Inside each topic directory:
- index.md (mandatory): topic overview, current stance, links to all notes
- notes/*.md (optional): individual notes, one thought per file
- drafts/*.md (optional): rough fragments
- archive/*.md (optional): falsified/superseded material (kept for history)

Each note file starts with:
- Status: sketch | hypothesis | tested | falsified | abandoned
- Confidence: low | medium | high

## Topics
- ATLAS N: topics/atlas-n/index.md

## Public reading note
Treat this as a lab notebook, not a promise.
